## ($COLD) Red Mercury | DAO Edition 
### (Tron Network only)

Contract: **TLGm9Z8ajK4hNvnCX9vQ44bYt2yffw9PN1**

**Description**: Introductory governance asset to **COLD** DeFi Banking Suite & Asset DAO for time-locked XFG Certificate Of Ledger Deposit yield.

**Decimals** : 12

**Maximum Supply** : **80**

**Current Circulating Supply**:  [*19.262603971250*](https://tronscan.org/#/token20/TLGm9Z8ajK4hNvnCX9vQ44bYt2yffw9PN1)

**DAO Governance** (project) : Any amount (See [goverance section](#cold-governance))

**DAO Governance** (monetary) : 0.1 $COLD required (See [goverance section](#cold-governance))

**DAO Governance** (list new asset) : burn of 1.0 $COLD required (See [goverance section](#cold-governance))

**XFG Interest Rate** : 80%   (using a **supply** ratio of $COLD to $XFG as 1:100000 or 1 $XFG = 0.00001 $COLD) 

     example rate:   80 $XFG deposit principal @ term yields 0.000640 $COLD as interest
                    800 $XFG principal @ term yields 0.0064 $COLD
                  8,000 $XFG principal @ term yields 0.064 $COLD
                 80,000 $XFG principal @ term yields 0.64 $COLD
                                 
Initial offering of 69 available for purchase thru smart contract @ fixed base price of **1 TRX** = 0.000625 $COLD 

A 'premine' of 11 $COLD were sent to a development wallet- using six (6) $COLD for network stewardship rewards to XFG Elder Node operators, as well as, five (5) $COLD reserved for interest payment option on XFG deposits.

Fixed price offering will end after either 1) all 69 tokens are sold or 2) Fango deposit code is successfully implemented, whichever arrives first. 
In the event of unsold tokens, any remaining $COLD will be either a) added to reserve and used as interest option for XFG deposit yield or b) burned.  

TronLink or Ledger wallet is required for all smart contract interactions (including buyToken;)

(*) limited by fixed supply & ultimately we want a full distribution of tokens, so as to be in the hands of DAO members for governance.

<h2 id="cold-governance">COLD Asset DAO | Governance</h2>

COLD's Asset DAO is a group of governing members to the DeFi Banking Suite. Members will vote on anything from project branding to interest rates and integration of new financial assets to COLD's yield market. In order to list a new asset to be offered as banking rewards, a DAO member must first propose a vote. After a positive majority voting decision has been reached, a DAO member must burn 1 full COLD token before integration may occur. Effectively reducing total supply, while also limiting the total amount of possible integrations. For limited-run assets, such as NFT collections or other fixed supply assets, further use of the COLD issuance integration is permitted for offerring additional assets, only if managed and issued by the same party or project elected for the original asset integration.
    
 -  1st Governance session (3/20/21) : Holding a minimum of 0.1 $COLD is now required for Monetary Policy while holding ANY amount of $COLD allows users to vote on Project Governance decisions.  

Proposals: Using above requirements, anyone may propose a topic upon which to vote so long as they a) hold the min req amount -&- b) make some kind of improvement to the voting interface from previous voting session.
