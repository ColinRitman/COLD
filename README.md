# COLD | Fuego's Defi Banking Suite & Interest DAO

 
 The purpose of **COLD** [Banking Suite] is to create a defi infrastructure of community-based token rewards for interest on term-locked (90 days) $XFG deposit yield.
 
 Allowing for a *multitude* of **off-chain** assets to serve as interest on  $XFG ledger deposits- while simultaneously preserving Fuego's fixed supply & hard money principals.
 
 All $XFG **c**ertificate of **l**edger **d**eposit steps are completed using the [Fuego Desktop Wallet](https://github.com/usexfg/fuego-wallet), while all $COLD, and other  DeFi community-led tokens (determined by DAO) reward steps will be completed using your DeFi wallet of choice. 

Below is a detailed list of yield options offered thru **COLD** [Banking Suite].

Contract: **TLGm9Z8ajK4hNvnCX9vQ44bYt2yffw9PN1**

**Ticker** : COLD

**Description**: Original asset of the **COLD** [Banking Suite] + governance token of COLD DAO

**Decimals** : 12

**Total Supply** : **20** (80 total; 4 defi platforms @ 20 COLD each) 

**Max Supply**: Dynamic

**Current Circulating Supply**:  [*19.262603971250*](https://tronscan.org/#/token20/TLGm9Z8ajK4hNvnCX9vQ44bYt2yffw9PN1)

**DAO Governance** (project) : Any amount (See [goverance section](#cold-governance))

**DAO Governance** (monetary) : 0.1 $COLD required (See [goverance section](#cold-governance))

**DAO Governance** (list new asset) : burn of 1.0 $COLD required (See [goverance section](#cold-governance))

**XFG Interest Rate** : as COLD and XFG are the same supply by atomic unit (only decimal place differs) interest is paid using a **supply** ratio of $COLD to $XFG as 1:100000 or 1 $XFG = 0.00001 $COLD

                       Every time XFG doubles/halves in price, interest rates in Red Mercury will rise/fall by half.
                       
                       XFG at $0.0015 =  0.15% APR paid in COLD
                       XFG at $0.0033 =  0.33% APR paid in COLD
                       XFG at $0.0075 =  0.75% APR paid in COLD
                       XFG at $0.0125 =  1.25% APR paid in COLD
                       XFG at $0.0250 =  2.5% APR paid in COLD
                       XFG at $0.05   =  5% APR paid in COLD
                       XFG at $0.10   =  10% APR paid in COLD
                       XFG at $0.20   =  20% APR paid in COLD
                       XFG at $0.40   =  40% APR paid in COLD
                       XFG at $0.80   =  80% APR paid in COLD
                       XFG at $1.50   =  150% APR paid in COLD
                       XFG at $3.00   =  300% APR paid in COLD
                       and so on and so forth.

    example yield @ 80% :
                    800 $XFG principal @ term yields 0.0064 $COLD
                  8,000 $XFG principal @ term yields 0.064 $COLD
                 80,000 $XFG principal @ term yields 0.64 $COLD
                                 
Initial offering of 69 available for purchase thru smart contract @ fixed base price of **1 TRX** = 0.000625 $COLD 

A 'premine' of 11 $COLD were sent to a development wallet- using six (6) $COLD for network stewardship rewards to XFG Elder Node operators, as well as, five (5) $COLD reserved for interest payment option on XFG deposits.

Fixed price offering will end after either 1) all 69 tokens are sold or 2) Fuego deposit code is successfully implemented, whichever arrives first. 
In the event of unsold tokens, any remaining $COLD will be either a) added to reserve and used as interest option for XFG deposit yield or b) burned.  


(*) limited by fixed supply & ultimately we want a full distribution of tokens, so as to be in the hands of DAO members for governance.

Community created assets such as limited-run NFT collections, fixed supply assets, infinite supply assets, etc. 

**Proposals**: Using the requirements below, any DAO member may propose a topic upon which to vote- so long as the proposing member holds the min req amount based on proposal topic. (project or monetary) 

 -  1st Governance session (3/20/21) : The holding amount required for Monetary Policy has been lowered from 1 $COLD to now a minimum of 0.1 $COLD while holding ANY amount of $COLD allows any member to vote on Project Governance decisions.
