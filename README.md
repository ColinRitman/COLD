Contract: **TLGm9Z8ajK4hNvnCX9vQ44bYt2yffw9PN1**

**Ticker** : COLD

**Description**: Introductory governance asset to **COLD** DeFi Banking Suite & Asset DAO for time-locked XFG Certificate Of Ledger Deposit yield.

**Decimals** : 12

**Total Supply** : **80**

**Current Circulating Supply**:  [*19.262603971250*](https://tronscan.org/#/token20/TLGm9Z8ajK4hNvnCX9vQ44bYt2yffw9PN1)

**DAO Governance** (project) : Any amount (See [goverance section](#cold-governance))

**DAO Governance** (monetary) : 0.1 $COLD required (See [goverance section](#cold-governance))

**DAO Governance** (list new asset) : burn of 1.0 $COLD required (See [goverance section](#cold-governance))

**XFG Interest Rate** : as COLD and XFG are the same supply by atomic unit (only decimal place differs) interest is paid using a **supply** ratio of $COLD to $XFG as 1:100000 or 1 $XFG = 0.00001 $COLD

                       Every time XFG doubles/halves in price, interest rates in Red Mercury will rise/fall by half.
                       
                       XFG at $0.0015 =  80% APR paid in COLD
                       XFG at $0.0030 =  120% APR paid in COLD
                       XFG at $0.0060 =  180% APR paid in COLD
                       XFG at $0.0120 =  270% APR paid in COLD
                       XFG at $0.0250 =  405% APR paid in COLD
                       XFG at $0.050  =  608% APR paid in COLD
                       XFG at $0.100  =  912% APR paid in COLD
                       XFG at $0.200  =  1368% APR paid in COLD
                       XFG at $0.40   =  2052% APR paid in COLD
                       XFG at $0.80   =  3078% APR paid in COLD
                       XFG at $1.50   =  4617% APR paid in COLD
                       XFG at $3.00   =  6925% APR paid in COLD
                       and so on and so forth.

    example yield:  800 $XFG principal @ term yields 0.0064 $COLD
                  8,000 $XFG principal @ term yields 0.064 $COLD
                 80,000 $XFG principal @ term yields 0.64 $COLD
                                 
Initial offering of 69 available for purchase thru smart contract @ fixed base price of **1 TRX** = 0.000625 $COLD 

A 'premine' of 11 $COLD were sent to a development wallet- using six (6) $COLD for network stewardship rewards to XFG Elder Node operators, as well as, five (5) $COLD reserved for interest payment option on XFG deposits.

Fixed price offering will end after either 1) all 69 tokens are sold or 2) Fango deposit code is successfully implemented, whichever arrives first. 
In the event of unsold tokens, any remaining $COLD will be either a) added to reserve and used as interest option for XFG deposit yield or b) burned.  

TronLink or Ledger wallet is required for all smart contract interactions (including buyToken)

(*) limited by fixed supply & ultimately we want a full distribution of tokens, so as to be in the hands of DAO members for governance.

<h2 id="cold-governance">COLD Hivemind Asset DAO | Governance</h2>

COLD's Asset DAO is the group of governing members stewarding the excellence of her Banking Suite and the election of COLD Asset Delegates and/or new asset integrations. Members will vote, according to required holding amounts, on a range of topics from project branding to annual interest rates and the selection of new financial instruments made available to users in COLD's yield market.

**Asset Integration**: In order to list a new asset to be offered for banking rewards, a DAO member must first call a vote on the proposed asset. If a positive majority voting decision has been reached, DAO member(s) must burn a total of 1 full COLD token at the time of integration. This will effectively create a deflationary pressure by reducing total supply, while also raising scarcity of available integrations by limiting the total amount of possible asset issuers. Limited-run assets, such as NFT collections or other fixed supply assets, may continue using their existing COLD integration for the additional offering of assets if elected as a COLD Hivemind Asset Delegate, and only if managed and issued by the same elected party or project delegated for the original asset integration.  

**Proposals**: Using the requirements below, any DAO member may propose a topic upon which to vote- so long as the proposing member holds the min req amount based on proposal topic. (project or monetary) 

 -  1st Governance session (3/20/21) : The holding amount required for Monetary Policy has been lowered from 1 $COLD to now a minimum of 0.1 $COLD while holding ANY amount of $COLD allows any member to vote on Project Governance decisions.
