     example rate:   80 XFG deposit principal @ term yields 0.000640 COLD as interest
                    800 XFG principal @ term yields 0.0064 COLD
                   8000 XFG principal @ term yields 0.064 COLD
                 80,000 XFG principal @ term yields 0.64 COLD
                                 
Initial offering of 69 available for purchase thru smart contract @ fixed base price of **1 TRX** = 0.000625 COLD 

A 'premine' of 11 COLD were sent to a development wallet- using six (6) COLD for network stewardship rewards to XFG Elder Node operators, as well as, five (5) COLD reserved for use of interest payment option on XFG deposit yield.

TronLink or Ledger wallet is required for all smart contract interactions (including buyToken;)

Fixed price offering will end after either a) all 69 tokens are purchased or b) Fango deposit code is successfully implemented, whichever arrives first. 
In the event of unsold tokens, any remaining $COLD will be added to reserve and offered as a limited-time* option for interest payments on XFG deposits.  

(*) limited by fixed supply & ultimately we want full distribution of tokens quickly, so as to be in the hands of users for COLD governance.
