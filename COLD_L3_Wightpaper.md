# COLD L3 – Privacy-First Modular Roll-up  
### Lightpaper v0.9 • July 2025  

> "Merge-mined security, zero-inflation economics, and cross-chain liquidity — without surrendering privacy."

---

## 1  Executive Summary
COLD L3 is a next-generation roll-up that fuses the proof-of-work security of the **Fuego** blockchain with the scalability of **Arbitrum One**, the data-availability of **Celestia**, and a purpose-built privacy stack.  

* **Merge-Mined Security** — every COLD block-hash is embedded inside a Fuego PoW header, inheriting its immutability while retaining L2 finality on Ethereum.  
* **Zero-Inflation Gas Token (HEAT)** — supply originates **only** from verifiable burns of XFG on Fuego (1 XFG → 10 000 000 HEAT).  
* **Privacy by Default** — fixed-denomination deposits, Tornado-style mixers, confidential transfers, MEV-minimised sequencing, and Poseidon/Bulletproof precompiles.  
* **Two-Tier Validators** — democratic + guardian nodes share 100 % of transaction fees; no block rewards, no capital inflation.  
* **Cross-Chain Utility** — O-Tokens enable inverse exposure, governance, and protocol bonding on Solana and other chains.  

COLD L3 delivers a censorship-resistant, privacy-preserving execution environment for DeFi, payments, and beyond—without relying on trusted parties or perpetual token inflation.

## 2  Architecture Overview
```
Ethereum L1 ─┐  settlement & fraud proofs
              │
Arbitrum One ─┤  COLD state roots
              │
Celestia DA ──┘  encrypted tx blobs
        ▲
        │ merge-mining (PoW)
COLD L3 │ execution: HEAT, privacy, AMMs, etc.
        │
Fuego L1│ CryptoNote chain, XFG burns
```

1. **Execution** — Smart contracts run inside the COLD EVM (Erigon v2 + REVM) with privacy precompiles.  
2. **Data Availability** — Compressed, encrypted blobs are posted to Celestia; commitments are stored in both COLD and Arbitrum headers.  
3. **Settlement** — A batch poster publishes each COLD state root to Arbitrum; Ethereum L1 provides the final dispute window.  
4. **Merge-Mining** — Fuego miners include the current COLD block-hash and Celestia commitment inside their coinbase; the PoW seal binds both chains.

## 3  Token Economics
### HEAT — Scarce Gas Asset
• **Minting Rule**: 1 XFG burned on Fuego mints 10 000 000 HEAT on COLD (Arbitrum).  
• **Supply Cap**: Hard-capped by total XFG that can ever exist (≈ 8 Million ).  
• **Utility**: Gas, collateral, and base pair in AMMs.  
• **L3 Inflation**: **Zero** — no staking or block rewards. Validators earn fees in HEAT.

### O Token — Certificate of Ledger Deposit
• **Hard Cap**: 80 tokens (12 decimals).  
• **Role**: Captures a share of protocol fees and treasury bonding incentives.  
• **Cross-Chain Allocation**: 20 O tokens will exist **per chain** on four networks—COLD L3 (Arbitrum), Solana, and two yet-to-be-selected **TBD** chains—totalling 80.  
• **Governance Weighting**: O on **COLD L3** carries **40 %** of total voting power, while each satellite chain’s 20 O bucket represents **20 %**.  
• **Burn Mechanics**: 8 % of losing vaults in the Fuego Forecast prediction market are burned, permanently reducing supply.

## 4  Consensus & Security
1. **Pow Anchor** — Fuego’s 480-second blocks seal COLD block-hashes; altering COLD would require re-mining Fuego.  
2. **Roll-up Finality** — Arbitrum fraud-proof window inherits Ethereum finality.  
3. **Encrypted Mempool** — Celestia blobs are AES-GCM encrypted; keys released only after PoW nonce disclosure, neutralising early MEV.  
4. **Batch Auctions** — Residual MEV is captured via sealed-bid auctions, redistributing value **without new token issuance**—proceeds fund HEAT buy-back-and-burn and bolster the protocol treasury.

## 5  Privacy Stack
| Layer | Purpose | Technology |
|-------|---------|------------|
| Standardised Deposits | Perfect amount privacy | Fixed 0.8 XFG burns |
| Mixer & Nullifiers | Break deposit ↔ withdrawal link | Tornado-style Merkle tree |
| Confidential Transfers | Hide on-chain amounts | Pedersen + Bulletproof range proofs |
| Precompiles | Gas-efficient ZK ops | PoseidonHash (0x09), BulletproofVerify (0x0A), NoteCommit (0x0B) |
| Time-Lock Obfuscation | S mempool for ≈8 s | Witness-Encryption over PoW statement |

All features are optional at the contract level but *on* by default in protocol apps, ensuring network-wide anonymity sets.

---

## 6  Primary Use-Cases
1. **Private DeFi** — Confidential swaps, LP positions, and batch-auction DEX to eliminate front-running.  
2. **Cross-Chain Inverse Exposure** — O-Token dynamics let traders hedge XFG or participate in protocol yield.  
3. **Prediction Markets** — *FuegoForecast* on Solana settles outcomes via encrypted oracles and feeds liquidity into COLD.  
4. **Institutional Settlement** — Dual L1/L2 finality, deterministic fee market, and privacy controls satisfy compliance-minded counterparties.

## 8  Governance & Community
• **Validators** — 15 democratic + 6 guardian operators share 95 % of fees; 5 % to protocol treasury.  
• **On-Chain Voting** — O-Token holders govern treasury spend and parameter changes, with **COLD L3 O tokens weighted 2×** relative to each satellite allocation.  
• **Rotation & Slashing** — Validators rotate monthly/quarterly; faults are slashed in HEAT.  
• **Grants Program** — Treasury allocates 10 % of holdings annually to ecosystem builders.

---

## 9  Regulatory & Compliance Notes
COLD is a *decentralised software protocol.* HEAT and O tokens provide utility (gas, governance, bonding) and do **not** constitute promises of profit.  

* Smart-contract code, security audits, and formal proofs will be published under permissive licences.  
* No custody of user funds; all burns and mints are user-initiated and provably irreversible.  
* Data-availability and encryption ensure user privacy without violating chain transparency requirements.

## 10  Conclusion
COLD L3 unifies PoW security, L2 scalability, and cutting-edge privacy into a coherent, economically sound roll-up. By anchoring to Fuego and Ethereum while leveraging Celestia DA, the network delivers censorship-resistant settlement, zero-inflation tokenomics, and a first-class developer experience.
